Kubernetes Pull Request Enviroments
===================================

Is a simple example of how to implement a process of deploy by branch to a Openshift Kubernetes cluster.

Using [Buddy](https://buddy.works/) as CI and [Getup Cloud](https://getupcloud.com/) OpenShift Cluster to deploy. I do resgister the deployments into GitHub using the [Deployment API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/) they provide.

You can see my post about this in here:
